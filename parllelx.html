            </div>
             <p class="text">Biking, also known as cycling, is a popular sport that involves riding a bicycle for various purposes, including recreation, transportation, and competition. Cycling has been around for over a century and has evolved into many different disciplines, including road cycling, mountain biking, track cycling, and BMX racing. Biking is not just a sport but also a means of transportation that provides numerous health benefits such as improved cardiovascular fitness, increased muscle strength, and reduced stress levels.

            Biking as a sport has gained popularity in recent years, with professional cycling events such as the Tour de France attracting millions of viewers worldwide. Biking competitions require contestants to demonstrate their endurance, speed, and tactical skills as they navigate through challenging terrain, steep hills, and varying weather conditions. Professional cyclists train rigorously to improve their stamina, technique, and mental toughness, often using specialized equipment such as aerodynamic bikes and advanced wearable technology to gain an edge over their competitors. Biking competitions not only test the physical and mental abilities of athletes but also provide a platform for them to showcase their determination and passion for the sport.

                <h2 class="head">PARA GLIDING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Paragliding is an adventure sport that involves flying through the air using a parachute-like wing. The paraglider is made up of a canopy of fabric cells that are inflated by the wind, allowing the pilot to soar through the sky. The pilot is suspended underneath the canopy by a harness and controls the paraglider's speed and direction using brakes and weight shift. Paragliding can be done solo or in tandem with a trained instructor and can take place in various locations such as mountains, hills, and coastal cliffs.
            <br> <br>
            Paragliding is a thrilling and exhilarating experience that allows people to see the world from a whole new perspective. It offers a sense of freedom and weightlessness as the pilot soars through the air, taking in the stunning views below. However, paragliding can also be a dangerous activity if proper safety measures are not followed. Pilots must have proper training and certification, use appropriate equipment, and carefully monitor weather conditions to avoid accidents. With proper preparation and caution, paragliding can be a rewarding and unforgettable experience for adventure seekers.

            </div>
            <p class="text">Surfing is a water sport that involves riding waves on a specially designed board.

The sport requires a combination of balance, agility, strength, and timing to master, and can be done in various bodies of water, including oceans, lakes, and rivers.
          <br> <br>

Professional surfing competitions attract some of the world's best surfers, who compete in different categories such as longboard, shortboard, and big wave surfing. In addition to being a sport, surfing also has a strong cultural significance, with many surfers embracing a laid-back, beach lifestyle and a deep connection to nature. Surfing can provide numerous physical and mental health benefits, including increased cardiovascular fitness, stress relief, and a sense of camaraderie among fellow surfers.
